      <p>My earliest memories of programming are from before I was 10 years old. I can remember spending hours with Grandpa on his TI-99 copying BASIC code out of programming books. It was like magic. At that age, the thought of being able to code seemed so unobtainable, I'm sure it never even crossed my mind. This experience though definitely planted the seed for my love of technology.</p>

      <p>Years later, I took a computer science class and was one again exposed to programming, but this time using C++. Wow, I loved that class. But it was just one class. In the following year, I attempted to teach myself C++ using what few resources I had, but let's face it - the material available for teaching yourself programming in 2001 weren't quite what we have today. I only wish I had the drive and passion then as I do now.</p>

      <p>After school, I decided to kickstart myself into a career by becoming an electrician and joining an apprenticeship program. Being an electrician has been a very rewarding experience. I've gained an insane amount of skills in many areas, not just the mechanical/physical installation and troubleshooting of an electrical system, but valuable skills managing projects and people, purchasing and handling materials, tools, and equipment, estimating project costs, working under pressure, facing strict deadlines, and learning how to work closely with customers to fulfill their specific needs. The greatest growth I experienced however is in the way I approach problems. My thought processes and the steps that I take to work through a problem in order to find the solution have not only been crucial to my success in the electrical industy, but have been greatly beneficial in all aspects of my life.</p>

      <p>In the summer of 2016, I was working on a personal project in Linux and was frustrated that after years of tinkering with this operating system, I still didn't really know what I was doing. I started digging deep into learning the BASH shell and after working through a few tutorials, I was so reminded of learning C++ years ago and how much I enjoyed it... but this time there was no stopping me. I immediately jumped into learning Python and was blown away at the amount of resources available. Afer learning basic Python syntax and a few programming fundamentals, I noticed how important the world of web development is, so I shifted my focus towards it a bit. Starting with the obvious basics of HTML/CSS, then moving to JavaScript on the front-end, and finally circling back to Python/Django in back, I've been working hard, studying, and learning tirelessly in every bit of my spare time. My interests are definitely not strictly in web development and I would love to make other types of applications and games, but that will all come in time. </p>

      <p>I know that I am meant to write code. I have never felt so passionate about anything in my entire life. Not realizing this or embracing it when I was younger... doubting myself... not pushing myself... these are some of the biggest regrets of my life. I am fully dedicated and determined to "right my wrong" and am going to do whatever it takes to succeed. Failure is not an option - I just don't operate that way. I'm amazed at what I've been able to accomplish in less than a years time and I can't wait to see what the next 5, 10, or even the rest of my life have to bring!</p>
