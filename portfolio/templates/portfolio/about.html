      <p>    My earliest memories of computer programming are from before I was 10 years old. I can remember spending hours with Grandpa as we were copying code out of programming books into his TI-99 in BASIC. It was like magic. At that age, the thought of being able to code seemed so unobtainable, I'm sure it never even crossed my mind. But this definitely planted the seed for my love of technology.</p>

      <p>    Years later, at 18, I took a computer science class and was exposed to programming once again using C++. I absolutely loved that class. But it was just one class and in the months following, I attempted to teach myself C++ using what few resources I had, but I was quickly filled with doubt. Let's face it, the material available for teaching yourself programming in 2001 weren't quite what we have today.</p>

      <p>I ultimately decided to kickstart myself into a career by becoming an electrician and joining an apprenticeship program. Being an electrician has been a rewarding experience. I've gained an insane amount of skills in many areas, not just the mechanical/physical installation and troubleshooting of an electrical system, but valuable skills in management. This includes managing projects, materials, assets, and people, estimating costs, working under pressure while facing strict deadlines, and working closely with customers to fulfill their needs - just to name a few. Perhaps the greatest single skill I've gained though is just in how I am able to approach problems in general. The thought processes and steps that I take to work through a problem in order to find the solution have not only been crucial to my success in the electrical industy, but have been greatly beneficial in all aspects of my life.

      <p>In the summer of 2016, I was trying to do some things inside of Linux and just got frustrated that after years of tinkering with this amazing operating system, I still really didn't know what I was doing. So I began digging deep into learning the BASH shell. Working through a few tutorials, I was reminded of learning C++ years prior and how much I enjoyed it... but this time there was no stopping me. I immediately jumped into self-teaching myself Python and was blown away at the amount of resources available for learning. A little while into learning Python syntax and the basics of programming, I realized how large and important the world of web development is, so I shifted my focus a bit. Starting with the obvious basics of HTML/CSS, then moving to JavaScript on the front-end, and finally circling back to Python/Django in back, I've been working hard, studying, and learning tirelessly in every bit of my spare time. I know I was meant to program. I absolutely love it and feel very passionate about it. I'm amazed at what I've been able to accomplish in less than a years time and I can't wait to see what the next 5 have to bring.</p>
